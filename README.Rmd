This repository collects twitter data and stores it to my own personal s3 bucket. More specifically, it... 

* Uses `rtweet` to search for tweets with _"johnson and johnson"_ or _"johnson & johnson"_ in the text.
* Compares new tweets to tweets that I have already collected by filtering out status IDs that already exist.
* Saves the dataset to a personal s3 bucket.
* Does this daily using a cron job from `cronR`.

I have no real use case for this at the moment. I am more or less just interested in setting up a job to collect data. I think of it as a kind of template that I may come back to if there is any twitter data I'd like to routinely collect.
